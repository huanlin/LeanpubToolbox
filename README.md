# Snippets-for-Leanpub
Code snippets for writing Leanpub e-books.

Currently only one snippet file included for Atom editor, which is inspired by Maksim Surguy's [leanpub-snippets](https://github.com/msurguy/leanpub-snippets).

[Click this link to watch the demo](https://github.com/huanlin/Snippets-for-Leanpub/blob/master/Atom/snippets-demo.gif).

If you'd like to contribute, kindly improve existing snippets, or provide your own code snippets for other editors (e.g. Visual Studio Code). Much appreciated.

## Installation for Atom

I didn't bother to create an Atom package, so simply a copy-and-paste will do the trick:

1. Open your snippets file from Atom editor. You can do this by clicking "File > Snippets..." from main menu.
2. Copy text from Atom/snippets.cson and paste it to your snippets.cson, save it. Done.

Note that you may need to install [Markdown Grammer](https://atom.io/packages/language-markdown) package.
